# Image-Captioning-System-Using-Deep-Learning
Making use of (Language model + Image model) to generate captions on flikr8k images. CNN + LSTM + Transfer learning
## What Is Image Captioning Using Deep Learning?
Image Captioning Using Deep Learning Deep Learning Application. In Which we have to pass the image to the model and the model does some processing and generating captions or descriptions as per its training. This prediction is sometimes not that much accurate and generates some meaningless sentences. We need very high computational power and a very huge dataset for better results.

## How To Run This Project?
1.  Download and extract [Flickr8k_Dataset.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y37dUIocd2hjADk7FmMP-ptmzAssFQcN/view?usp=sharing) and [Flickr8k_text.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/179RcanAzTFNXguIboXn2ZI1hx7tWKk16/view?usp=sharing)
2.  Now, create a folder named 'ML' in root directory of your Google Drive.

3.  Then upload extracted version of `Flickr8k_Dataset` and `Flickr8k_text` into the ML folder. This may take times depending on your IP provider.

4.  Also upload the `testing_caption_generator.py` into ML folder.

5.  Now create a notebook in Google Colab by Image_Captioning_Using_Deep_Learning name, and copy paste Shells from `ImageCaption.ipynb`

6.  Then Run all the shells.

Do not use it for Commercially.
